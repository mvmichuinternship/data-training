1. Data Integration Components
Azure Data Factory (ADF):

Pipelines: ADF uses pipelines to orchestrate data workflows. Pipelines can include various activities such as data movement, data transformation, and data ingestion.
Data Flows: For data transformation, ADF uses Data Flows, which are visually designed and allow for complex transformations using a graphical interface.
Activities: ADF has various activities like Copy Activity, Data Flow Activity, Lookup Activity, and more, which can be used to perform different tasks within a pipeline.
Linked Services: Define connection information to data sources. Supported sources include Azure Blob Storage, SQL databases, and more.
Datasets: Represent data structures and are used to define input/output data for activities.
Talend:

Jobs: Talend uses Jobs to design and execute data integration processes. Jobs are created using a drag-and-drop interface and can involve multiple components.
Components: Talend provides a wide array of components for various tasks, including input/output, transformation, and processing. Examples include tInput components (like tFileInputDelimited), tOutput components (like tFileOutputDelimited), and transformation components (like tMap).
Connections: Talend uses connection components to interface with various data sources and destinations, such as databases, files, and cloud services.
Metadata: Talend has robust metadata management for defining and reusing data structure information.
2. Transformation Features
ADF:

Data Flows: ADF’s Data Flows provide a visual way to design transformations, similar to Talend’s mapping tools. You can perform operations like filtering, aggregating, and joining data.
Mapping Data Flows: Allows complex transformations with features like data partitioning, expression language, and mapping data from source to sink.
Custom Code: Supports running custom code via Azure Functions or Data Bricks.
Talend:

tMap Component: A powerful transformation component that allows for complex data mappings, lookups, and expressions.
Data Quality Tools: Talend includes built-in tools for data profiling, cleansing, and enrichment.
Custom Code: Users can integrate Java code directly into jobs for specialized transformations.
