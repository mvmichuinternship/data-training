Use OLAP cubes or summary tables to store aggregated data for quick access.
ETL Process Workflow
Extract

Source Systems: POS (Point of Sale), CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
Data Extraction: Periodic extraction from source systems using APIs, batch files, or database queries.
Extract Data: Sales transactions, customer details, product information, store data, promotion details.
Transform

Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct data inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Convert data formats, calculate derived metrics (e.g., total sales, discount totals), and normalize data to match schema requirements.
Data Aggregation: Aggregate data at daily, weekly, and monthly levels for efficiency.
Load

Load Data into Staging Tables: Load cleaned and transformed data into staging tables for validation.
Validation: Check for data integrity, consistency, and accuracy.
Load into Data Warehouse: Move validated data from staging tables into the final fact and dimension tables in the data warehouse.
Update and Maintenance

Incremental Load: Implement incremental loading to update only changed data rather than full reloads.
Data Quality Checks: Regular checks to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Performance Tuning: Optimize queries and indexing based on query patterns and performance metrics.
Monitoring and Reporting

ETL Monitoring: Implement monitoring to track ETL process health and performance.
Reporting: Provide reporting interfaces for stakeholders to access aggregated sales and promotion data.
